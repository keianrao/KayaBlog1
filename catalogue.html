                Hello!
                This web application makes heavy use of HTML and CSS, but it is still a JavaScript web application..
                So it won't run without JavaScript turned on.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a demo of a blogging software.
                Functionality wise, it's the usual - it has lists of articles you can browse, and you can submit articles.
                But I'm experimenting with the layout of where I put all the elements of the page, to try to avoid friction in the browsing experience,
                with actual browsing of multiple articles in mind (as opposed to stopping by for one page).
                Technology wise, the articles are not files on the web server that you can navigate to and be served with.
                They're fetched from a database, gated by a backend server that the JavaScript code running in this page will communicate over HTTP with.
                Hence why this is a JavaScript web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                When JavaScript is turned off, or the JavaScript engine isn't up and running yet, or the database is yet to be connected to,
                there should be no content other than this notice. If there are, pardon me, I wrote something wrong, and, please ignore them.
            </p>

            <h1>Articles</h1>
            <ul id="articles-list">
                <!-- sic. An ordered list might make more sense but, we're going to do our own numbering scheme for articles, I think.. -->
            </ul>
